# SearchNemo

A simple text search tool for [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) and [Jolla phone](http://jolla.com/) devices.
It searches local directories for a given text inside various file types.
It can also find file and directory names containing searched text.

### Features
 * Search local directories for a given text inside files and return result list divided into sections
 * Selectable start directory (also as a command line parameter)
 * Searched text is always case insensitive
 * Currently supported search targets: Notes app database, files (text, html, [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/), filenames, directory names
 * Special search inside Notes app database (with indication of note number containing searched text)
 * Clear search results when press&hold on search field
 * Customization of search (selection of file types, max. nr of displayed search results)
 * On/off search in hidden files and directiories
 * On/off symbolic links support
 * Dynamically extended sections of search result list
 * Cumulative and plain view of search result list
 * Detailed view of searched text with context
 * Dynamically extended detailed file info
 * Detailed view of sqlite database record containing searched text
 * Possibility to select and copy text (open by tapping text in detailed view)
 * Preview html files
 * Open app to which found database belongs to
 * Open files (if xdg-open finds a preferred application)
 * Preview JPEG, PNG and GIF files
 * Play back WAV, MP3, OGG and FLAC audio
 * Install Android APK and Sailfish RPM packages

### Search method
Search function is line oriented.
It assumes the serched files (except sqlite db) contain newline character. If the newline character isn't present, then the whole file is treated as a single line.

### Data safety
SearchNemo does not open any files for writing (except own config file), so there is no danger to corrupt any files stored on device.
It does not collect nor store any data from search results. It works offline and does not need network connection.
Since it is able to open local html files, it is possible to open any links (local and remote) in these files and in that case a network connection may be used.

### Translations
Currently supported languages:

 * English
 * Polish
 * German (partially)
 * Swedish (translation made by Ã…ke Engelbrektson)

### Author's comments and plans
I didn't find any similar application for Sailfish OS, so I decided to write one.
Since I kept a lot of txt and html files locally on device, I needed a tool which could find any text inside files and nicely show results.
It is always possible to do the same task using find program in command line, but ... do we have to always use command line tools having so pretty graphical os?

As a starting point I took very good app: File Browser (see Acknowledgements) and adopted search function to my needs.
Current developement state suites me well for simple tasks, but it can be just a starting point for further development.
Application is currently in alpha state.
Any comments, new ideas and pull requests are very welcome.

Plans:

 * to introduce regular expression search
 * to open desired app with a parameter (if app allows it)
 * to search inside other files (ie. pdf)
